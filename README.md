# Driver Development of 16x2 Liquid Crystal Display on STM32 

# ðŸš€ What is Liquid Crystal Display?

A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is an electronic visual display that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers to produce images. It is widely used in devices like monitors, calculators, and embedded systems for clear and energy-efficient visual output.

# ðŸš€ How to Use an LCD with Microcontrollers?

Using an LCD with a microcontroller involves connecting the displayâ€™s data and control pins to the microcontrollerâ€™s GPIO pins, then programming the microcontroller to send commands and data to the LCD. 

Typically, you initialize the LCD in your code, configure it for the desired display mode (such as 16x2 characters), and then write text or custom characters to the screen. This process allows the microcontroller to visually present information, making debugging and user interaction easier.
